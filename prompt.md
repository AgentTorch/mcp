Can you run a simulation of an Antarctic ecosystem with 1000 leopard seals (predators) and 9000 emperor penguins (prey) over 50 steps? I'm interested in understanding how the predator-prey dynamics evolve in this harsh environment, especially considering the limited food resources. Please analyze the population trends and explain any important ecological observations.
